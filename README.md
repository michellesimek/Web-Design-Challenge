## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this homework assignment, we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations crated from a previous assignment looking at city weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. 

The website consists of 7 pages total including:

1. Landing Page
- The landing page included an explaination of the project and links to each visualization page.

2. Visualization Pages
    - The visualiztion pages should images and paragraphs explaining the plots and the significance.
    - Each pages compared the latitude of the cities to one of the following:
        - Cloudiness
        - Wind Speed
        - Max Temperature
        - Humidity 

3. Comparison Page
    - The comparsion page showed all the plot visualizations, so you could easily compare them to one another. 

4. Data Page
    - The data page displayed a responsive table containing data used to create the visualizations. 


At top of each page, there is a navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate through the site or return to the landing page.
